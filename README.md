# Advent of Code Java Template

_(inspired by https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-kotlin-template/)_

[Advent of Code][aoc] – an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
We offer you a template prepared to use with Java within this repository.

## Workflow
**Advent of Code Java Template** is a particular type of GitHub repository that lets you speed up the setup phase and start writing your AoC solutions immediately.

The general idea is straightforward – to create a new project based on this template, you need to log in to your GitHub account and use the **Use this template** green button.
And remember – **do not fork it!**

From now, everything's in your hands!
Join the [Advent of Code][aoc] contest, solve the Day 1 as soon as it is published.

For the following days, copy the `Day0.java` solution file and increment the day number.

> Note: All task input files under `src/main/resources` are excluded from the repository with `.gitignore` – we should not post them publicly, as Eric Wastl asks for: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081).
